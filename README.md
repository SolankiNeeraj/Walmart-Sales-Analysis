# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
Businesses today are transforming by making data-backed decisions. 

It is important to connect with the data, to derive meaningful insights from it. I spent my weekend challenging myself to create this Excel Dashboard using Walmart Sales data (obtained from Kaggle open datasets) and derive conclusions to enable the management take informed decisions for growth of the company.

Key Highlights from the Analysis:

1. The Sales growth is steadily for the past 3 years with increasing or nearly same Profit Margin.
2. California and Washington are key performing states sharing between them more than 80% of Sales and Profit.
3. Chairs and Phones are highest sales generating categories, while Copiers and Accesories are highest profit generating categories.

Points to consider for Management decisions:

1. Arizona and Colorado stand third and fourth respectively in terms of Sales, but they also account to highest losses. Here, it is necessary to understand the reason for it and develop a strategy to turn them profitable.
2. Chairs generate highest Sales amongst categories and also come in top 4 in terms of average sales value per order, but it contributes not so much to the profits. It also has very negligible average profits per order. Here, the management needs to develop a strategy to make it more profitable.

Using the Slicer for further Statewise Analysis:

1. While California hast seen a steady Sales growth over years, there is a massive Sales growth in Washington for year 2014. Binders and Paper are top product categories in both the states.
2. When looking for same product categories in least profitable states (Colorado and Arizona), Binders and Paper are again top categories in terms of number of orders. However, while Profit Margin for Paper is relatively same as top performing states, the Profit Margin for Blinders is amongst the worst for both of them.
   Thus, the management needs to understand why Binders are not profitable in these states and how to turn them profitable.
